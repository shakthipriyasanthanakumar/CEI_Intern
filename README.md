# 🌐 CEI Internship Tasks – June 2024

Welcome to the official repository containing all the tasks and projects I completed during my internship at **Centre for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI)** from **June 16th to June 30th, 2024**.

## 📌 About the Internship

This two-week internship focused on building hands-on experience with **AI tools**, **data-driven applications**, and **cloud deployment techniques**. I had the opportunity to explore practical implementations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), chatbot systems, and interactive UIs using platforms like **Kaggle**, **Colab**, and **GitHub**.

Below are the core projects and notebooks included in this repository:

### 🧠 Projects & Notebooks

| Notebook | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Copy_of_RAG_with_Gemini_and_Chromadb.ipynb` | 📄 Implementation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using **Gemini API** and **ChromaDB** to create a question-answering system from documents. |
| `intern_task1.ipynb` | ⚙️ Basic foundational task to understand the working of LLM-powered applications, preprocessing, and response generation. |
| `intern_task2.ipynb` | 🔄 Advanced continuation from Task 1 – pdf upload |
| `Image_Edge_Detection_Colab_Notebook.ipynb` | 🖼️ A computer vision task using **OpenCV** and **Canny edge detection** to detect edges in uploaded images. |
| `AI_agent_using_LangGraph.ipynb` | 🤖 Built an **AI Agent** workflow using **LangGraph**, showcasing multi-step reasoning and interaction over documents or user prompts. |
